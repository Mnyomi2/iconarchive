# 🎨 IconArchive Perfect Selective Downloader

An advanced, multi-threaded, and highly customizable Python scraper designed to download massive icon sets from [IconArchive.com](https://www.iconarchive.com) flawlessly. 

It features smart skipping, missing-file detection, selective format filtering (Vector, PNG, Mac, Windows, Favicon), and a robust Command Line Interface (CLI).

---

## ✨ Features

- **🚀 Multi-Threaded:** Uses Python's `ThreadPoolExecutor` for lightning-fast, concurrent downloading.
- **🧠 Smart Resuming & Updating:** Built-in logic checks existing files. If a download was interrupted, or if new icons were added to the site, it will **only download the missing files**—saving massive amounts of bandwidth and time.
- **🎯 Selective Formats:** Choose exactly what you want: `vector`, `png`, `mac`, `windows`, `favicon`, or `all`.
- **📂 Batch Processing:** Read a list of designers/artists from a simple `Designer.txt` file to process dozens of pages automatically.
- **🛡️ Safe & Resilient:** Handles HTTP `429 Too Many Requests` rate-limits, connection timeouts, and missing elements gracefully.
- **🗂️ Clean Output:** Automatically organizes everything perfectly into `Artist / Set / Format` folders, complete with JSON manifests.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IconArchive-Downloader.git
cd IconArchive-Downloader

2. Install required Python packages:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml tqdm

3. Create your Designer.txt list: Create a text file named Designer.txt in the
same directory as the script. Add the names of the artists (exactly as they
appear in the IconArchive URL), one per line. Example (Designer.txt):

papirus-team
justicon
gartoon-team

(If you run the script without this file, it will automatically create a
template for you).

💻 Usage & CLI Commands

The script features a very flexible command-line interface. You can mix and
match Artists, Action Flags, and Formats.

📝 Available Arguments

  - Action Flags: update, force, all
  - Formats: vector, png, mac, windows, favicon
  - Artists: Any unrecognized word is treated as a specific artist name.

🌟 Examples

1. Default Batch Run (Smart Skip) Reads Designer.txt. If an artist folder
already exists, it skips them completely to save time. Downloads all formats for
new artists.

python iconarchive_perfect_selective.py

2. Update Everything (Fill in the blanks) Reads Designer.txt, but forces a scan
on already downloaded artists. It checks the website and compares it to your
local files, downloading only what is missing.

python iconarchive_perfect_selective.py update

3. Download Specific Formats Only (e.g., Vector & PNG) Reads Designer.txt but
will only download Vector and PNG files.

python iconarchive_perfect_selective.py vector png

4. Force Update a Specific Format for Everything Checks all artists in
Designer.txt and downloads any missing Vector files, even if the artist folder
already exists. (Keeps your existing PNGs untouched!)

python iconarchive_perfect_selective.py force vector

5. Target a Specific Artist Ignores Designer.txt and only processes
papirus-team. Downloads all formats.

python iconarchive_perfect_selective.py papirus-team

6. Target a Specific Artist + Update + Specific Formats Scans only papirus-team.
It checks their folders and downloads only missing Vector and PNG files.

python iconarchive_perfect_selective.py papirus-team update vector png

📁 Output Folder Structure

The script will automatically create a root folder called iconarchive and
organize files like this:

iconarchive/
└── Papirus-Team/
    ├── Papirus-Apps/
    │   ├── Vector/
    │   │   ├── icon1.svg
    │   │   ├── icon2.svg
    │   │   └── Vector.json    <-- Tracks downloaded files
    │   ├── PNG/
    │   │   ├── icon1.png
    │   │   └── PNG.json
    ├── Papirus-Places/
    ...
